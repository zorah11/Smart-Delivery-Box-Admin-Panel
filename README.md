## üöÄ Deployment

This project is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch.

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Preview production build locally:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

3. Push changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. GitHub Actions will automatically deploy to Pages.

## üîê Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the keys you plan to use. The project supports two SMS providers (configurable): `bulksms` and `textbelt`.

Example `.env`:

```env
# ThingSpeak (used to sync PINs to the locker)
# Write key (used to write/update fields)
VITE_THINGSPEAK_WRITE_KEY=your_thingspeak_write_key
# Read key (optional) used when fetching channel status
VITE_THINGSPEAK_READ_KEY=your_thingspeak_read_key
# Channel ID
VITE_THINGSPEAK_CHANNEL_ID=3021205

# Which SMS provider to try first: "bulksms" or "textbelt" (default: bulksms)
VITE_SMS_PROVIDER=bulksms

# BulkSMS API key (if using BulkSMS)
VITE_BULKSMS_API_KEY=your_bulksms_api_key

# Textbelt API key (optional fallback). Use "textbelt" for the free tier or your paid key.
VITE_TEXTBELT_KEY=textbelt
```

Important notes about SMS and CORS:

- Many SMS providers (including BulkSMS) do not allow direct browser requests from arbitrary origins. That can cause network/CORS errors when your site is hosted on GitHub Pages.
- This project will attempt the provider configured in `VITE_SMS_PROVIDER` (default `bulksms`). If that request fails (network/CORS), it will automatically try Textbelt as a fallback if `VITE_TEXTBELT_KEY` is set.
- For production use you should move SMS sending to a server-side component to keep API keys secret and avoid CORS restrictions. If you must call an SMS API from the browser, verify your provider supports CORS and public API keys.
